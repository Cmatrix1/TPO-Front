                            <h3>Groundwater</h3><span><span id="shouldFocus">üî∑</span>Groundwater
                                is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground, filling
                                all the available spaces. By far the most abundant type of groundwater
                                is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of
                                the water cycle. Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into
                                the ground from the surface, from precipitation (rain and snow) and from
                                lakes and streams. There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before
                                emerging at the surface again. At first thought it seems incredible
                                that there can be enough space in the ‚Äúsolid‚Äù ground underfoot to hold
                                all this water.<br><br>The necessary space is there, however, in many
                                forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particles‚Äîsand grains
                                and tiny pebbles‚Äîof loose, unconsolidated sand and gravel. Beds of this
                                material, out of sight beneath the soil, are common. They are found
                                wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed. For
                                example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the
                                last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from
                                them. The water was always laden with pebbles, gravel, and sand, known
                                as glacial outwash, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.<br><br>The
                                same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a
                                sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto
                                relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water
                                usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the sediment in the form of a
                                smooth, fan-shaped slope. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows
                                on entering a lake or the sea, the deposited sediments are on a lake
                                floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some
                                future date, when the sea level falls or the land rises, and such beds
                                are sometimes thousands of meters thick.<br><br>In lowland country
                                almost any spot on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a
                                river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the
                                water‚Äôs upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the
                                former riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.<br><br>So
                                much for unconsolidated sediments. Consolidated (or cemented)
                                sediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding pores. This is
                                because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally plugged
                                with cementing chemicals; also, parts of the original grains may become
                                dissolved by percolating groundwater, either while consolidation is
                                taking place or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone,
                                for example, can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was
                                formed.<br><br>Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment,
                                loose or cemented, consists of empty space. Most crystalline rocks are
                                much more solid; a common exception is basalt, a form of solidified
                                volcanic lava, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very
                                porous.<br><br>The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its
                                porosity. But note that porosity is not the same as permeability, which
                                measures the ease with which water can flow through a material; this
                                depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the crevices linking
                                them.<br><br>Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated sediment
                                or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place.
                                But some will remain, clinging to all solid surfaces. It is held there
                                by the force of surface tension without which water would drain
                                instantly from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. The total volume
                                of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as
                                consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, drain away.<br><br>The
                                relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one
                                kind of rock or sediment to another, even though their porosities may be
                                the same. What happens depends on pore size. If the pores are large,
                                the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface tension to
                                hold, and it will drain away; but if the pores are small enough, the
                                water in them will exist as thin films, too light to overcome the force
                                of surface tension holding them in place; then the water will be firmly
                                held.<br></span>

                            <h3>Groundwater</h3><span><span id="shouldFocus">üî∑</span>Groundwater
                                is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground, filling
                                all the available spaces. By far the most abundant type of groundwater
                                is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of
                                the water cycle. Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into
                                the ground from the surface, from precipitation (rain and snow) and from
                                lakes and streams. There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before
                                emerging at the surface again. At first thought it seems incredible
                                that there can be enough space in the ‚Äúsolid‚Äù ground underfoot to hold
                                all this water.<br><br>The necessary space is there, however, in many
                                forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particles‚Äîsand grains
                                and tiny pebbles‚Äîof loose, unconsolidated sand and gravel. Beds of this
                                material, out of sight beneath the soil, are common. They are found
                                wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed. For
                                example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the
                                last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from
                                them. The water was always laden with pebbles, gravel, and sand, known
                                as glacial outwash, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.<br><br>The
                                same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a
                                sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto
                                relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water
                                usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the sediment in the form of a
                                smooth, fan-shaped slope. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows
                                on entering a lake or the sea, the deposited sediments are on a lake
                                floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some
                                future date, when the sea level falls or the land rises, and such beds
                                are sometimes thousands of meters thick.<br><br>In lowland country
                                almost any spot on the ground may overlie what was once the bed of a
                                river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the
                                water‚Äôs upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the
                                former riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.<br><br>So
                                much for unconsolidated sediments. Consolidated (or cemented)
                                sediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding pores. This is
                                because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally plugged
                                with cementing chemicals; also, parts of the original grains may become
                                dissolved by percolating groundwater, either while consolidation is
                                taking place or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone,
                                for example, can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was
                                formed.<br><br>Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment,
                                loose or cemented, consists of empty space. Most crystalline rocks are
                                much more solid; a common exception is basalt, a form of solidified
                                volcanic lava, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very
                                porous.<br><br>The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its
                                porosity. But note that porosity is not the same as permeability, which
                                measures the ease with which water can flow through a material; this
                                depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the crevices linking
                                them.<br><br>Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated sediment
                                or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place.
                                But some will remain, clinging to all solid surfaces. It is held there
                                by the force of surface tension without which water would drain
                                instantly from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. The total volume
                                of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as
                                consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, drain away.<br><br>The
                                relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one
                                kind of rock or sediment to another, even though their porosities may be
                                the same. What happens depends on pore size. If the pores are large,
                                the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface tension to
                                hold, and it will drain away; but if the pores are small enough, the
                                water in them will exist as thin films, too light to overcome the force
                                of surface tension holding them in place; then the water will be firmly
                                held.<br></span>
